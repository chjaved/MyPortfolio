## 🚀 Getting Started

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before starting, make sure to set up all required environment variables in a `.env` file as described in the Environment Variables section below. The application will not work properly without these configurations.


1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rushikeshnimkar/portfolio2025.git
cd portfolio
npm install
```

2. Update your personal information:
```bash
# Edit the components/character/character.ts file with your own details
# This is crucial for the AI to represent you correctly
```

3. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
   > **Note:** The first run will take longer than usual as the system creates and saves your embeddings to the vector database. Take this time to relax and enjoy a coffee! ☕

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure to uncomment the following line in `api/chat/route.ts` when working in development:
> ```javascript
> // "http://localhost:3000",
> ```

- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Environment variable protection


## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```env
# Development environment (all the apis are free)
EMAIL_USER="your emailid"
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your App Password" # get it from your Google Account settings
ABSTRACT_API_KEY="your abstract api key" # https://app.abstractapi.com/
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your openrouter api key" # https://openrouter.ai/
TAVILY_API_KEY="your Tavily api key" # https://tavily.com/

# Vector Database (Pinecone)
PINECONE_API_KEY="your Pinecone API key" # https://app.pinecone.io/
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="your index name" # e.g., portfolio-embeddings

# Google Gemini (for embeddings)
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your Google API key" # https://ai.google.dev/
```

## Vector Store Configuration

The vector store is configured in `lib/embeddings.ts` with the following settings:
- Dimension: 768 (Google Gemini embeddings)
- Metric: Cosine similarity
- Pod type: Starter (free tier)

You can modify these settings in the `initializeVectorStore` function if needed.
